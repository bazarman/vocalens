    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>
      VocaLens (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use
      the VocaLens mobile application and website.
    </p>

    <h2>How VocaLens Works</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens is a text photo translator. The app allows users to take a photo,
      extract text from the image, and translate that text into another language.
    </p>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens uses the device camera to capture images for text recognition.
      Camera access is required solely for this functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Image and Text Recognition (OCR)</h2>
    <p>
      Text recognition is performed using Google ML Kit.
      Image processing and text extraction occur on the user’s device.
      Images are not uploaded, stored, or transmitted to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Text Translation</h2>
    <p>
      After text is extracted from an image, the text may be sent to
      ChatGPT-5 mini, a language model service, for translation.
      Only the extracted text is transmitted for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      No images, camera data, or personally identifiable information are sent.
      Translated text is returned to the device.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Users may choose to save images, extracted text, or translated text
      on their own device.
      This data is stored locally under the user’s control and is not accessed,
      collected, transmitted, or backed up by VocaLens.
    </p>

    <h2>User-Initiated Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens allows users to share images and/or translated text using
      the device’s built-in sharing features.
      Sharing is entirely optional and initiated by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not receive, store, or process any content that users
      choose to share. Shared content is handled according to the privacy
      policies of the destination apps or services selected by the user.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not collect, store, or share personal data.
      No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens displays advertisements provided by third-party partners,
      including AppLovin.
      These partners may collect limited, non-personal data such as device
      information or ad interaction data, in accordance with their own
      privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens integrates third-party services for text recognition,
      translation, and advertising.
      VocaLens does not control how these services handle data.
      Users are encouraged to review their respective privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
      Any changes will be posted on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
