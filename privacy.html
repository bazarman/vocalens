    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>
      VocaLens (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use
      the VocaLens mobile application and website.
    </p>

    <h2>How VocaLens Works</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens is a text-photo translator. The app allows users to take a photo,
      extract text from the image, and translate the text into another language.
    </p>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens uses the device camera to capture images for text recognition.
      Camera access is used solely for this core functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Image Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All image processing and text recognition occur locally on the user’s device.
      Images are not uploaded, stored, or transmitted to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Text Processing and Translation</h2>
    <p>
      After text is extracted from an image, the text content may be sent to a
      language model (LLM) service for translation.
      Only the extracted text is processed for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The translated text is returned to the device and is not stored by VocaLens.
      No images or personally identifiable information are included in this process.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not collect, store, or share personal data.
      No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or retained.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens displays advertisements provided by third-party partners,
      including AppLovin.
      These partners may collect limited, non-personal data such as device
      information or ad interaction data, in accordance with their own
      privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not control how third-party services handle data.
      Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these services
      for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
      Any changes will be posted on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

      official contact details are available.
