    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>
      VocaLens (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use
      the VocaLens mobile application and website.
    </p>

    <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens uses the device camera to recognize and translate text.
      Camera access is required solely for this core functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not collect, store, or share personal data.
      No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.

    <h2>Image Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All images captured by the app are processed only on the user’s device.
      Images are not transmitted to external servers, stored, or retained
      after processing.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens displays advertisements provided by third-party partners,
      including AppLovin.
      These advertising partners may collect limited, non-personal data
      (such as device information or ad interaction data) in accordance
      with their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not control how third-party advertising partners
      handle data. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies
      of these services for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      VocaLens does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe that personal data has been provided by a child,
      please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
